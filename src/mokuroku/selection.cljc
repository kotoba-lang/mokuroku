  "What the user has picked, kept across refreshes.

  Selection is stored as item **ids**, never as indices into the current
  result. Every one of these apps has a source that changes underneath the
  view — a process exits, a file is written, a track finishes importing — and
  index-based selection silently retargets when that happens: the user selects
  row 3, the list re-sorts, and the delete lands on someone else. Ids make the
  failure mode 'the selection shrank', which is visible and safe."
