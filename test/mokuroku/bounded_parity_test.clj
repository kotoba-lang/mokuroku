  "Binds `bounded.kotoba` to `selection.cljc` on the property it exists for.

  `bounded.kotoba` says in its own header that it is a narrowed profile which
  'proves the one property the whole suite leans on, which is that a selection
  is a set of *ids* and therefore survives the source changing underneath it'.

  It had never proved it against anything. CI compiles
  `test/mokuroku/bounded_conformance.kotoba` to `.mjs` and `.wasm` and asserts
  its `main` returns 42 — which shows the module links and executes on both
  runtimes, and shows nothing about whether it agrees with the Clojure model
  that ships. Two implementations of one rule, and only one of them could be
  wrong at a time without anything noticing.

  ## What is compared, and what is not

  `reconcile` on both sides is the intersection of the selection with the ids
  the source now yields. The `.cljc` carries two things the profile does not —
  `:selection/anchor` and `:selection/dropped` — so the comparison is over the
  KEPT SET, which is the part both express. The extras are checked on the
  Clojure side alone rather than pretended to be parity.

  ## `select` does not mean the same thing on the two sides

  The guest's `select` ADDS to the selection (`typed-set-conj`). The `.cljc`'s
  `select` REPLACES it — `{:selection/ids #{id}}`, which is click-to-select-one
  — and its adder is `toggle`. So the correspondence is guest `select` ↔ host
  `toggle`, and mapping them by name gives wrong answers: this test did, at
  first, and reported a disagreement that was its own. The names are pinned
  below so nobody resolves the collision by making them agree.

  Membership is read back through the guest's own `selected?` and
  `selection-count` rather than by picking apart the returned record, so this
  test does not depend on how a `[:set :keyword]` happens to be represented at
  the host boundary."
